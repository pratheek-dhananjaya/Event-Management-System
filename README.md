This system makes use of a technique called as the Hashing technique to store data entered by the user in file. The user can perform various actions such as Adding an event, deleting an event, searching for an event, etc. While adding the event, the user has to enter details such as event ID, Event name, Date of Conduction, Entry Fee and Prize amount.
